    text: 'This is our "go to" Saturday Brunch spot in Weaverville.  Josh and Kenny have made this such a welcoming and inclusive locale.  We especially love coming here when the weather is nice and we can sit on the covered patio.  They have great specialties that rotate each month.  This week it was "nana pudding" French Toast! YUM! Tasted as good as it sounds.  There are lots of locals that come here each week, but good for those visiting as well.  We enjoy the pet parade each week, watching folks walking their dogs or coming to Yellow Mug for a delicious repast with their pooch on the patio.',

    text: "Where does one go on a Sunday a.m. or any other day of the week for a home run meal? Yellow Mug Cafe/Coffee Lounge never disappoints. Top notch service, food, and atmosphere. They make the most of their space on a main street by providing ample indoor and outdoor, under cover, patio seating. There are also couples seating in front along the sidewalk abutting the establishment. They keep it interesting by seasonally changing up the menu, This a.m. I had their Churro French Toast...amazingly light and not overly sweet. The taste of cinnamon was the first to massage my taste buds. I was hooked and will be back to indulge again. My friend had the Chorizo Avo Toast...wheat berry toast topped with scrambled, chorizo, guac, pico, queso sauce with a side of hash browns. And the portions are very generous! Listen, if I haven't convinced you to check out this town gem then do a drive by on a Saturday a.m. and ask any of the patrons waiting in line to get in:-)",
